Repository to save my progress in OOP Java studies. I'm following this course: [curso em video](https://www.cursoemvideo.com/curso/java-poo/aulas/java-poo/)

**Class 2 - What is an Object?:**

All objects have attributes, methods, and states.
- class: define the attributes and methods
- object: it is a class instance

**Class 3 - What is Object Visibility?:**

UML: Unified Modeling Language
Class Diagram: class -> first letter is uppercase; attribute or method -> all letters are lowercase; method -> parentheses in the end.
Visibility modifiers: 
- +: public (all classes)
- -: private (only current class)
- #: protect (current class and sub-classes)
